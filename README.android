The source code of clang-8.0.0 was downloaded from
http://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/cfe-8.0.0.src.tar.xz

To build clang-8.0.0 for Android we first need to build clang-tblgen and
llvm-tblgen code generators. Both require subset of clang and llvm codebase
that does not require any of the  generated code.
